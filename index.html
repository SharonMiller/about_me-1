                <h1>Bio</h1>

                <p>I am an aspiring fullstack software developer who has done everything and am finally finding my home with developers. Along the way I have delved into  environmental science because of the world I love; have worked with non-profits because people have such tremendous capacity to be developed; have been a primary educator for my two little boys; and even worked with service plumbing and drain cleaning to be active in creation and service.</p>

                <h1> Goals</h1>

                <p>My goal at hand is to develop the necessary skills so that I can help people find technological solutions to their problems. With these doors opened, the sky is the limit. Computers and technology are integrated more and more with every facet of life and I hope to find meaningful contributions to human experience.</p>
