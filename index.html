                <h1>Bio</h1><hr/>

                <p>I am an aspiring fullstack software developer who has done everything and am finally finding my home with developers. Along the way I have delved into  environmental science because of the world I love; have worked with non-profits because people have such tremendous capacity to be developed; have been a primary educator for my two little boys; and even worked with service plumbing and drain cleaning to be active in creation and service.</p>
